Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us is a book by Daniel H. Pink, a bestselling author and a former speechwriter for Al Gore. The book challenges the conventional wisdom about human motivation and offers a new perspective on how to achieve personal and professional success.
     
In Drive, Pink argues that the old model of motivation, based on rewards and punishments, is outdated and ineffective in the modern world. He proposes a new model of motivation, based on three intrinsic elements: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. He explains how these elements can foster creativity, innovation, and engagement in individuals and organizations.
